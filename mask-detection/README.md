# Face-Mask Detection

In this problem I have used classification technique to differenciate/classify between face with mask or face without mask images. I have trained MobileNetV2 using Transfer learning for this problem. The accuracy achieved for training set is 98% and for validation 95%.

## Steps
1. Preparing Dataset
2. Preprocessing Data
3. Training Model
4. Testing Model

## Dataset
I have used a small dataset which is already included in the dtaset folder

## Training Model
I have used transfer learning for training.
I have used pretrained MobileNetV2 model.
Accuracy - Training accuracy = 98% & Validation accuracy = 95%
For more info - Go through the Training.ipnb

## Testing Model - 
Open Testing.ipnb file
Everything is well documented & explained
